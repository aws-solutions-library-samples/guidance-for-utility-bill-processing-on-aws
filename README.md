## Guidance for Utility Bill Processing on AWS

The sample code in this project deploys a customizable pipeline on AWS for converting utility bill invoices in a PDF format into a structured data schema for use in downstream analytics.

This workload can be used to extract billing and consumption insights from your conventional utility bills, then aggregate these insights to identify cost or sustainability KPIs such as buildings contributing the greatest emissions footprint within your portfolio.

### Cost

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Guidance. As of 29th August 2024, the cost for running this Guidance with the default settings in the Default AWS Region US East-1 (N. Virginia) is approximately $75.28 USD per month for processing 5000 utility bills per month in the solution.

We recommend creating a Budget through AWS Cost Explorer to help manage costs. Prices are subject to change. For full details, refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this Guidance.

### Sample Cost Table

The following table provides a sample cost breakdown for deploying this Guidance with the default parameters in the US East (N. Virginia) Region for one month.

| AWS service  | Dimensions | Cost [USD] |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Amazon Bedrock | 16,000,000 Input Tokens and 1,500,000 Output tokens using Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet | $70.50 |
| AWS Step Functions | 40,000 transitions using Standard workflows  | $1.00 |
| AWS Lambda |  10,000 invocations and 23781  GB-seconds | < $1.00 |
| Amazon S3 | S3 Standard storage (27 GB per month) | < $1.00 |
| others | Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon EventBridge  | < $1.00 |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You will need Docker, Node.js, Node Package Manager (npm), and AWS Cloud Development Kit installed on your local machine to build and deploy this project.
Also, make sure that the Docker daemon is running when you are deploying this solution.

- [Installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Start the Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/start/)
- [Installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Installing AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)

You will then need to [bootstrap](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_bootstrap) your AWS account using the CDK:

`cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION`

### Deploying the CDK stack

From the `source` directory, run the following commands:

`npm install`
`cdk synth`
`cdk deploy`

Once the deployment succeeds (you will need to accept the confirmation prompts on first deploy), the sample is ready for your use.

## Using the sample

To process an invoice through this sample, you will need to upload a PDF invoice to the deployed S3 bucket with an object prefix of `input/`. You can do this from the AWS Management Console for S3, programmatically with the AWS SDK, or using the AWS CLI.

You can get the name of the deployed bucket from the CloudFormation output called "invoiceBucket" that appears after running `cdk deploy`. You can also find it in the CloudFormation management console, or looking in your list of S3 buckets for the one prefixed "invoicestoinsightsstack-invoicesbucket".

If you have the [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), run this command from the parent directory of this project to put an invoice named `sample-invoice.pdf` in the bucket (provided in the `assets/` folder), triggering the processing workflow:

`aws s3 cp assets/sample-invoice.pdf s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/input/sample-invoice.pdf`

After about 30 seconds, the normalized output can be found in the same S3 bucket at the path `s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/output/my-invoice.pdf.json`. You can always find the results of processing by changing the invoice filename prefix to `output/` from `input/`.  You will also note a prefix `wip/` which is used for temporary data to pass between states of the state machine.

Please be aware that the uploaded invoices and all temporary data are set to expire after one day.  If you require this data longer, please update the S3 Bucket lifecycle policy to avoid data loss.

### Customizing the prompt

A sample prompt has been provided, which will be passed to Amazon Bedrock using the Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet model.  You will want to experiment with different prompts and customize for your use case.  There are 2 ways to customize the prompt.

1. To permapermanently change the prompt, edit the `prompt.txt` file and redeploy this solution.

2. For experimentation, you can manually start an execution of the `InvoiceToInsights` state machine.  It takes payload following the schema below, with an optional `prompt` parameter, which will be used instead of the default prompt.  All other executions will use the default prompt.

```json
{
  "Bucket": "<S3 Bucket deployed by the soluiton>",
  "Key": "input/<your-filename.pdf>",
  "prompt": "the prompt to use for this particular execution".
}
```

You can also customize the Foundational Model used by Amazon Bedrock by modifying the `MODEL_ID` variable in [source/lib/state-machine-construct.ts](/source/lib/state-machine-construct.ts)



## Security

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#security-issue-notifications) for more information.

## Cleanup

Note that tearing down the stack will destroy ALL contents of the S3 bucket!

To remove the sample stack from your AWS account, you can run the `cdk destroy` command from within the `source/` directory, or terminate the stack in the AWS management console from Amazon CloudFormation.
